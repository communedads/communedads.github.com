Adder Oaks and Keegan Dunn tackle the challenges of teaching sharing to children on a commune, where sharing already abounds! Are the sharing habits of commune kids actually any different than those of the mainstream? Adder and Keegan ponder whether forcing kids to share is the only way to actually make it happen, or if a lassiez-faire approach results in more compassionate behavior. They discuss a scholarly article about sharing in children, the utopian novel The Dispossessed, and fill in with their own anecdotes about the hoarding behavior of, well, basically every kid they have met.
