Welcome to the Commune Dads podcast! Hosted by adder Oaks and Keegan Dunn, this podcast explores parenting and education in alternative culture. We live in an income-sharing intentional community and want to share our experience with the world. Each episode we pick a topic to discuss and do a very good job of getting off track. From those interested in hearing anecdotes about life on a commune to those wanting to hear about the challenges that all parents face, this show has something for everyone.
