Presently, adder and Keegan pay for the hosting costs out of their $90ish monthly commune allowance. Although we enjoy making the show, it'd be nice if it didn't cut into our meager coffee, almond milk, and breakfast cereal budget.  Maybe you can help us! Monetary support on <a href="http://www.patreon.com/communedads">Patreon</a> or by <a href="#address">check</a> would be amazing. Alternately, shop online using our Amazon affiliate link, and we'll get a cut:
